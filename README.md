This is my Home Assistant configuration.
I'm currently running Home Assistant version __0.51.2__. Installation used is [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), running on a Raspberry Pi 3, with [HypriotOS](https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/)

When the HA configuration is ready, Kubernetes will be the deployment platform (See [Jarvis](https://github.com/zeiot/jarvis))
